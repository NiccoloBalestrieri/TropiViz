Data Visualization

> ğŸš€ I've just created a data visualization application using Dash! ğŸ“Š
I'm proud to introduce TropiViz: Understand Your Data, an application I've developed to simplify the analysis of time-series data from CSV files. Here's what it does:
>ğŸ“‚ Data Loading: The app allows you to easily upload a CSV file by specifying the file path. My code uses the Pandas library to read and prepare the data for visualization.
>ğŸ“… Date Range Selection: You can select a date range to analyze specific time periods in the data. I've included a date picker to make this operation straightforward.
>ğŸ“ˆ Interactive Charts: The app generates interactive charts using Plotly Express to visualize time-series data. The charts are fully customizable and support displaying multiple variables simultaneously.
>ğŸ“‹ Data Table: The data table displays detailed data beneath the chart. You can examine the detailed data and even export it for further analysis.
>ğŸ”„ Reset Dates: Additionally, I've included a button to easily reset the date range to the default value.
